Ans?

	Step 1: first initialize the max number and the sum;
		int f= 4000000;
		int sum = 0;
	Step 2: then create a for loop for iteration
				for(int i=1;i<=f;i++)

	Step 3: the in an if condition specify the numbers to be even

		if(i%2==0)

	Step 4: then  sum+=i;
				
				sum = i;
				i = sum+i;
		where, the formula for sum is given, and the next number is assigned to initial number and the nex numbers is fed to the sum;


		
	Step 5: print the result.
